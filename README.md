**Objective:** A *simple* and *well-designed* template structure to start a machine learning/deep learning-based project. The template provides a basic directory structure with additional files (like [`notebooks/pytorch-boilerplate.ipynb`](./notebooks/pytorch-boilerplate.ipynb) to perform EDA. In addition, the template is designed such that code can be deployed into production. *Quickly get started* working on the code and preparing documentation as highlighted below. To understand the template check [**HOWTO.md**](./HOWTO.md) file.

## Setup

Please follow the following steps to run the project locally <br/>

1. `git clone https://github.com/m-np/ai-ml-project-template.git`
2. Open Anaconda console/Terminal and navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
3. Run the following steps:
```
   conda create -n <env_name> python==3.10
   conda activate <env_name>
   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir

   conda activate <env_name> && pre-commit install -t pre-commit
   conda activate <env_name> && pre-commit install -t pre-push

```

For adding the new conda environment to the jupyter notebook follow this additional instruction
1. Run `conda install -c anaconda ipykernel`
2. Run `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env_name>`

-----

For pytorch installation:

PyTorch pip package will come bundled with some version of CUDA/cuDNN with it,
but it is highly recommended that you install a system-wide CUDA beforehand, mostly because of the GPU drivers.
I also recommend using Miniconda installer to get conda on your system.
Follow through points 1 and 2 of [this setup](https://github.com/Petlja/PSIML/blob/master/docs/MachineSetup.md)
and use the most up-to-date versions of Miniconda and CUDA/cuDNN for your system.

-----

For other module installation, please follow the following steps:
1. Open Anaconda console/Terminal and navigate into project directory `cd path_to_repo`
2. Run `conda activate <env_name>`
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` found ðŸ‘‰ [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt)
